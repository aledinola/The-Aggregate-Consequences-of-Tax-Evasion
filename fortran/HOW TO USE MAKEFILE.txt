On a Windows computer, please follow these steps:

1) Launch the command prompt from Intel Visual Fortran

2) Change directory to where the fortran sources are stored, 
   e.g. type the following in the command prompt: 
   cd "..\codes and data\Fortran files\Source Codes\v3\windows" 

3) Type "nmake /f makefile_win clean" in order to delete old files

4) Type "nmake /f makefile_win" in order to compile the Fortran source files
   and generate an executable called "fortran_win64.exe"

5) Copy "fortran_win64.exe" and save it in the "Matlab\exe" folder

N.B. In (1) it is important to launch the command prompt from Intel Visual Fortran
N.B. If you add a .f90 file to the project, you have to modify the makefile
     accordingly
